Hapify was born out of the desire to accelerate modern development, by replacing traditionnal static boilerplates with dynamic boilerplates.

Hapify removes the need to write repeating boilerplates for extended CRUD operations for both back-end & front=end development.
Focus on features instead of doing repetitive work!

* Hapify is an agnostic code generator allowing the creation of any kind of app.
* Hapify takes two inputs, relational data-models and code templates.
* Hapify does not command any paradigm or code structure. Users can define their own code templates with their preferred language.

To be more efficient, the generated code is meant to be used within a boilerplate.
Therefore, boilerplates for Hapify embed compatible code templates. You can browse community boilerplates [here](https://hub.hapify.io).
